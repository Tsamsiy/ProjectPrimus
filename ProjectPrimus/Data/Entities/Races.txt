Racial traits
	Wraith have a second, hidden pool of reserve health. This reserve can be replenished
	if feeding (see Feeding section) exceeds 100% on regular health. Damage taken does not
	affect this reserve.
	A Wraith can use this reserve to regain regular health (see natural regeneration section).

	Feeding
		A method of transfering health between a Wraith and other humanoid entities.
		This transfer can be bidirectional. If Feeding takes place between to Wraith,
		the health transfer can be specified to only take place between their reserves.
		
		Target must be grappled, prone, restrained or incapacitated.
		The player specifies an amount of health and in which direction the transfer takes
		place. They then roll 1d100 + Con modifier to determine the efficiency.
		If feeding takes place during combat, the specified amount is capped at 25.
		
		If the target is not willing, opposing Con ability checks are rolled.
		On a successful save, the transfered amount is multiplied by 50%.
		failed save: specified hp * (1d100 + Con mod)
		succeeded save: specified hp * (1d100 + Con mod) * 0.5
		If the target is unconscious, the opposing checks are not rolled.

		If the target is willing, no opposing checks are rolled and 100% efficiency is asumed.

	natural regeneration
		A method of healing oneself.
		Only affects the player themself.

		While out of combat, a player regains a maximum of health equal to their Con modifier
		every 10 minutes in-game time.
		If the amount of replenished health is less the regenerated amount, the remaining
		percent-points remain in the players's health reserve.

		During combat, the player can take an action to heal themselves.
		The amount of regenerated percent-points is capped at 25 before rolling for efficiency.
		regenerated health = specified hp * (1d100 + Con mod)
		If the regenerated amount is greater than the remaining reserve, the player regains a
		maximum of the amount remaining in their reserve.

Racial traits
	Replication
		Replicator players can convert pure metal objects into nanites, which join that unit's
		mass, effectively healing it. The object needs to weigh at least 2.2lb/1kg

		While out of combat, a player regains a maximum of health equal to their Con modifier
		every 10 minutes in-game time. This process consumes 1d100 % of the original mass of
		the metal object. If the rolled consumed mass is greater than the mass left, the player
		regains their Con Modifier * leftover mass % of health.

		Depending on the consumed material the new nanites now have the similar properties.
		For example consuming a metal with a low melting point, makes the unit vulnerable to
		heat.

	Shape Shifter
		A Replicator can match their outer appearance to any entity they had touched before.

	Subspace network
		Replicators can nonverbaly communicate with any other unit in the same solar system.
		This effect is proportionally amplified with the replicator mass gathered in a 2u cube.

	Goa'uld Symbiote
		This parasitic snake-like creature lives inside a human host, effectively replacing
		its immune system. The symbiote grants its host super-human strength and constitution
		and can perform basic repair and filter tasks.

		While out of combat, a player regains a maximum of health equal to their Con modifier
		every 10 minutes in-game time.

		During combat a player can use their symbiote to activate a temporary surge, gaining
		complete immunity to paralysis status effects, +10 to every attack roll and additional
		2u of movement per turn for 1d4 turns.
